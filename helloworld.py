# Python is a very simple language, and has a very straightforward syntax. It encourages programmers
#to program without boilerplate (prepared) code. The simplest directive in Python is the "print" directive - it
#  simply prints out a line (and also includes a newline, unlike in C).

# There are two major Python versions, Python 2 and Python 3. Python 2 and 3 are quite different.
#  This tutorial uses Python 3, because it more semantically correct and supports newer features.

#For example, one difference between Python 2 and 3 is the print statement. In Python 2, the "print" statement
#  is not a function, and therefore it is invoked without parentheses. However, in Python 3, it is a function,
#  and must be invoked with parentheses.

#To print a string in Python 3, just write:

print("Hello, world!")
